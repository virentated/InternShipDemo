# Web Application for Canada Post

This is my project that I worked on as part of my internship at Canada Post. We developed a mobile and desktop friendly application for mercahnts and consumers 

## Background Information
This is a new look website for Canada Post that was developed as a proof-of-concept by my team as part of an innovation pod at Canada Post. The web application has a mobile and desktop version which has a fully implemented sign-in feature. There is a different version for consumers shown by Ed's pprofile and a different one for merchants which is shown by a fictional company called SportsHub.
